This project was bootstrapped with Create React App

This is my portfolio website coded in React here is a screenshot of the page:

Things I learned or practiced in this project:
* Compartmentalising code so it's easier to organise and easier to find bugs later.
* Importing all your components to one main file where it will all be rendered later.
* How to import pictures in React.
* Functional components (I have done a little bit of class-based components).
* Import Font Awesome Icons using the i element so I can use the Github and LinkedIn icons.
